This program implements a highly efficient calculating engine for
a pocket calculator. It includes a complete test rig to demonstrate
that the engine works as it should.

Question 22.
This was printed :
Testing the addition operation.
The result is: 7
Testing the subtraction operation.
The result is: 5
All tests passed.

I have no idea what operations are being peformed,
so I don't trust the last statement.

Question 23.
It first gives 1 then gives 7. 
If the same equation was being performed, it should've given the
same answer. Checking the code, you find out that 3+4 is being 
executed, the answer is 7.

Question 24. 
No it doesn't, first it gives 9 then -13.

Question 25.
I feel like this program is pretty primitive, because it only does 2 
calculations and it doesn't even do it correctly.
